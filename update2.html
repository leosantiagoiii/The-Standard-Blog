			<h1>It's Fila Seazn</h1>

			<p>Since its early days as a sporting goods manufacturer based out of the small, northern Italian town of Biella, FILA has grown to become an international powerhouse, providing active wear to the style conscious among us.</p>
			<p>The timeless red, white and blue palette, along with the trademark logo, has taken the brand from the sport field into the streets. Famous advocates include Tupac, LL Cool J and Nas – proving the Italian label has serious street cred among ‘90s hip-hop royalty.</p>

			<p>Caps and fanny packs – or “roadman bags” as they have been cleverly rebranded – were embroidered with your name in the classic FILA font.</p>
			<p>While Fila have done an excellent job of rehashing its classic steez of ‘90s bangers in recent collections, the sportswear masters have packed up and gone home to shoot an entire lookbook in a quaint, Italian village called Biella, at the foothills of the Alps.</p>
			<p>With an eye on their archive, the new collection revives ‘70s details like waffle track ensembles and zipped polo necks, and features a playful approach to its statement logo, in homage to the loud exuberance of the brand’s golden era. The color palette is gentler than usual, with new muted pastel options like powder pink and blue, alongside classic tones such as navy, black and gray, plus bold infusions of bright yellow and red.</p>
			<p>Fila’s SS17 lookbook also marks the first campaign that both the U.S. and UK divisions of the brand have collaborated since Fila’s recent revival. As a result, the brand’s latest effort draws inspiration from streetwear trends across both sides of the Atlantic. The two territories will continue to work closely together going forward, ensuring a more holistic aesthetic for Fila’s future.</p>
